# Phrygia Font

***Times-like OFL font***

that's basically it

## Notes

* The regular italic font has a broken line height. I do not know how to fix this and I do not expect to be fixing this.
* It is not recommended to use the TTC font. As of v1.000 it only includes the Italic and Bold Italic fonts, and this may or may not be fixed in due course.

## Downloads

You can either go to phrygia-font/fonts to find the files, or refer to the Releases.
